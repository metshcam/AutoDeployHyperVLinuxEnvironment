## Step by step instructions on manually building and configuring 
## a basic CentOS 8 virtual machine, based on HyperV Gen2, using EFI
####

####
## Prepare HyperV environment
####

1) Enable all virtual technology on your system, as Gen2 virtual machines will require some updated hardware for some more recent functionality

2) It is strongly recommended that you not use a WiFi adapter as your network card, when using a Bridged/External network environment type 

3) Although the initial script will verify and install it, you should install the 'OpenSSH Client' feature offered for free under your Windows settings

4) Logically create your virtual disk and machine locations, and a location to store your .iso files
  - e.g. 
    e:\hyperv\machines
    e:\hyperv\disks
    e:\hyperv\iso
  
####
## Prepare parent virtual drive
####

1) Download the most recent version of CentOS 8, minimal installation ISO file
  - CentOS-8.2.2004-x86_64-minimal.iso
  - http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/centos/8.2.2004/isos/x86_64/CentOS-8.2.2004-x86_64-minimal.iso
  - Copy CentOS-8.2.2004-x86_64-minimal.iso file to e:\hyperv\iso
  
2) To create a new virtual disk, launch your Hyper-V Manager GUI/interface:
  - From Hyper-V Manager, right-click your server/host and select; New --> Hard Disk
  - Select the following options for your (Gen2/EFI) virtual drive:
    - VHDX
    - Dynamically expanding
    - Name: CentOS8_parentdisk.vhdx
    - Location: e:\hyperv\disks
    - Size: 40gb (we can always expand on the drive later with the proper configuration)

5) Once the disk is created, we need to create a new virtual machine:
  - From Hyper-V Manager, right-click your server/host and select; New --> Virtual machine
  - Select the following options for your (Gen2) virtual machine:
    - Name: CentOS8_base
    - Generation: 2
    - Memory: 2048
    - Use dynamic memory
    - Connection: Default Switch
    - Attach a virtual disk later
    - Create the disk
    - Open File Explorer, and browse to your hard drive location (e.g. e:\hyperv\disks\)
  - Validate that CenOS8_base.vhdx exists. (e.g. it will start at 4MB in size)

6) Now we need to make changes to the virtual machine, to support our operating system installation:
  - From Hyper-V Manager, select your server/host, and you should see your newly built virtual machine listed
  - Right-click the virtual machine, and select, "Settings..."
    - Security tab (note: there are limitations to using these features, these are not production ready builds):
      -Secure boot: Disabled
      - TPM: Disabled
      - Shielding: Disabled
    - Memory tab:
      - RAM: 2048MB
      - Dynamic memory: Enabled
        - Min RAM: 512MB
        - Max RAM: 2048MB
        - Memory buffer: 20%
        - Memory weight: 0/50%
    - Processor tab:
      - 4 virtual (i.e. depends on system, requirements)
      - Default settings (i.e. some advantages can be had with newer hardware)
    - Network tab:
      - Virtual switch: Default Switch
    - Integration services: All offered
    - Checkpoints: All disabled
    - Automatic start/stop: N/A

7) Now that we've applied the new settings to this virtual machine, we need to attach our drive
  - Right-click the virtual machine, and select, "Settings..."
    - SCSI Controller tab:
      - Select "Hard drive"
      - Click, "Add"
      - SCSI default controller/location
      - Media:
        - Virtual hard disk:
          - Click, "Browse..."
          - Select e:\hyperv\disks\CentOS8_base.vhdx
      - **If DVD drive does not exist in virtual machine, create new DVD drive through SCSI controller

8) Mount the CentOS8 Minimal .iso file to the virtual machine
  - Right-click the virtual machine, and select, "Settings..."
    - Select SCSI Controller tab
    - Select DVD drive and under the Media options, choose "Image File" and mount your .iso from e:\hyperv\iso\

9) Assign boot order under your virtual machine Settings --> Firmware and use the "Move Up/Down" buttons to adjust your DVD drive as your first in the boot order

10) Launch virtual machine from Hyper-V Manager, and right-click the virtual machine, and select "Connect" to launch the console GUI interface
